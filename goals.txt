Meshes in json:
- Simplify skybox
- Don't use MainShader class and whatnot

- See if we even need to set things like the material properties in the uniform variables each frame or if that's preserved
- Make collider its own thing
- Potentially use lodepng for skybox instead of whatever we use
- Use lodepng for m_texture as well
