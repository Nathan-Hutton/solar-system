Meshes in json:
- Simplify skybox
- Don't use MainShader class and whatnot

- See if we even need to set things like the material properties in the uniform variables each frame or if that's preserved
- Make collider its own thing
- Potentially use lodepng for skybox instead of whatever we use
- Use lodepng for m_texture as well
- Make spotlight less complicated (not a point light) like it is the 6610 projects.

- Instead of calling useLight for the spotlight, call setLight. Same with PointLights
